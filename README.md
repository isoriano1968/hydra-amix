# AMIX Hydra Ethernet Driver

A STREAMS/DLPI network driver for the **Hydra Systems AmigaNet rev 1.2a** Zorro II Ethernet card (National Semiconductor DP8390/NE2000) for **AMIX 2.1p2** — Commodore's System V Release 4 Unix for the Amiga.

## Background

AMIX (Amiga Unix) is SVR4 Unix for Motorola 68020+ Amiga systems, originally developed by Commodore-Amiga and later sold by Haage & Partner. It includes a fully-functional STREAMS networking stack with DLPI-based Ethernet drivers.

The existing AMIX kernel ships with the `aen` driver for the Commodore A2065 Ethernet card (AMD LANCE-based). This project adds support for a second NIC: the **Hydra Systems AmigaNet**, a Zorro II card built around the ubiquitous **National Semiconductor DP8390 (NE2000)** chip.

The driver follows the same DLPI/STREAMS architecture as the A2065 driver, making it a useful reference for anyone porting other Zorro II network cards to AMIX.

## Driver Architecture

The driver is a STREAMS DLPI provider (`struct streamtab hydrainfo`) registered at cdevsw slot 47, using major/minor device `hya`. It follows the same pattern as the A2065 (`aen`) driver:

- **`hydraopen()`** — STREAMS open; calls `hydraautoconfig()` to detect the card, then `hydra_initialize()` to set it up
- **`hydraautoconfig()`** — three-method card detection (runs once, cached):
  1. `autocon(NE8390_BOARD_ID, ...)` — uses kernel's bootinfo autoconfig table with Zorro II address validation
  2. Direct Zorro II I/O slot probe — reads MAC PROM at each 64 KB slot (0xE90000-0xEFFFFF)
  3. Memory space probe — scans Zorro II memory space (0x200000-0x9FFFFF) at 64 KB steps
- **`hydrawput()`** — STREAMS write-side put procedure, handles DLPI primitives (DL_INFO_REQ, DL_BIND_REQ, DL_UNITDATA_REQ, etc.)
- **`hydraintr()`** — INT2 interrupt handler, registered in `int2_tbl[]`, processes RX/TX/error interrupts from the DP8390
- **`setup_ne2000()`** — initializes the DP8390 registers, ring buffers, and physical address

## Building

### Prerequisites

- **AMIX 2.1p2** installed on an Amiga (A3000/A4000) with development system
- **Native GCC 2.7.2.3** for AMIX (not included — download from [amigaunix.com](https://amigaunix.com) as pkg format)

### Kernel build

The driver is compiled natively on the Amiga under AMIX. No cross-compiler is required.

```sh
su
cd /usr/sys/amiga/driver/hydra
make
```

This produces a relocatable object file `exp` that can be linked into a custom kernel.

To rebuild the full kernel with the hydra driver:

```sh
cd /usr/sys
make force
```

The `makedev` tool is used to install the device node:

```sh
mknod /dev/hya0 c 47 0
```

## Testing

### Manual interface setup

AMIX does not support `ifconfig plumb` (SVR4.0 predates that mechanism). The interface is plumbed via `slink`:

```sh
su
/usr/sbin/slink addaen /dev/hya0 hya0
/usr/sbin/ifconfig hya0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up -trailers
/usr/sbin/route add default 192.168.1.1 1
ping 192.168.1.1
```

The `route add default ... 1` suffix is the metric (required on AMIX).

### Boot-time configuration

Add to `/etc/inet/network-config` (sourced by `/etc/rc2.d/S69inet`):

```sh
/usr/amiga/bin/hya -S || exit 0
/usr/sbin/slink addaen /dev/hya0 hya0 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/ifconfig hya0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up -trailers
```

The `hya -S` line silently exits the script if no Hydra board is detected, preventing the boot script from hanging on `slink`.

## hya Control Utility

The `hya` tool (in `usr/sys/amiga/driver/hydra/hya/`) is a user-space utility for checking Hydra board presence and reading configuration. It is modeled after the `aen` tool for the A2065 card.

### Building

```sh
cd /usr/sys/amiga/driver/hydra/hya
make
make install          # installs to /usr/amiga/bin/hya
```

### Usage

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-S` | Silent check — exit 0 if board found, 1 if not (for boot scripts) |
| `-n` | Print number of Hydra boards detected |
| `-c` | Show MAC address, board base, and debug level |
| `-d dev` | Use alternate device (default `/dev/hya0`) |

### Boot script integration

The `hya -S` command is used to conditionally plumb the interface:

```sh
/usr/amiga/bin/hya -S && /usr/sbin/slink addaen /dev/hya0 hya0 && \
    /usr/sbin/ifconfig hya0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up -trailers
```

## Known Issues

- **autocon() table corruption**: The kernel's `autocon()` function reads from the `bootinfo` ConfigDev table populated by `config()` in `support.c`. On AMIX 2.1p2 the table entries can be corrupted (address/size mismatches), so the driver validates addresses and falls back to direct slot/memory probes.
- **PROM byte lane**: The MAC PROM at board+0xFFC0 uses 16-bit bus with step-2 byte access (every other byte). Direct reads without step-2 return garbage.
- **`ifconfig plumb` does not exist on AMIX**: Use `slink addaen /dev/hya0 hya0` instead. The interface name matches the device minor (`hya0` for minor 0).
- **Remote DMA hang**: The standard NE2000 byte-at-data-port RDMA method does not raise RDC on the Hydra card. The AmigaOS reference driver uses Hydra-specific ASIC registers (`HYDRA_LOAD1`/`HYDRA_LOAD2` at board+0x8000+0x7FD2/0x7FD5) and writes packet data directly to the card's buffer RAM at the board base address.
